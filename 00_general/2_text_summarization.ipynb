      "Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence field focused on developing statistical algorithms that learn from data to perform tasks without explicit programming. Deep learning, a subdiscipline, has significantly advanced ML performance using neural networks. ML is applied across various fields like natural language processing, computer vision, medicine, and business (predictive analytics). Its foundations lie in statistics and mathematical optimization, with data mining being a related field for exploratory analysis. Theoretically, ML is described by probably approximately correct learning, with most algorithms involving empirical risk minimization.\n"
